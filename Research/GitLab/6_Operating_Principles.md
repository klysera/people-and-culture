# GitLab Operating Principles

## Core Operating Philosophy
GitLab operates on principles that prioritize efficiency, transparency, and iteration in everything they do.

## Fundamental Operating Principles

### 1. Handbook-First Documentation
- **Everything is documented**: All processes, policies, and decisions
- **Single source of truth**: One canonical location for information
- **Publicly accessible**: Transparent by default
- **Continuously updated**: Living document, not static
- **Searchable and indexed**: Easy information discovery

### 2. Iteration Over Perfection
- **Minimal Viable Change (MVC)**: Ship smallest possible improvement
- **Two-way doors**: Most decisions are reversible
- **Bias for action**: Move fast and adjust
- **Learn from failure**: Fail fast, learn faster
- **Continuous deployment**: Multiple releases daily

### 3. Transparency by Default
- **Public over private**: Share unless there's a reason not to
- **Open salary framework**: Compensation calculator public
- **Meeting recordings**: Available for those who couldn't attend
- **Metrics dashboard**: Company performance visible
- **Decision rationale**: Document the "why" behind choices

### 4. Efficiency Focus
- **Boring solutions**: Choose proven over novel
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Invest in automation
- **Self-service model**: Enable independence
- **Frugality**: Spend like it's your money
- **Time respect**: Meetings as last resort

## Organizational Structure

## Decision-Making Framework

### Data-Driven Approach
- **Metrics before opinions**: Let data guide decisions

- **Transparency in metrics**: Share performance openly

### Decision Types
1. **Type 1 (Irreversible)**: Careful, slow, consultative
2. **Type 2 (Reversible)**: Fast, autonomous, iterative
3. **DRI decisions**: Owner makes the call
4. **Consensus not required**: Disagree and commit
5. **Escalation paths**: Clear when needed

## Communication Operating Principles

### Asynchronous First
