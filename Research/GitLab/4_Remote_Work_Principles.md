# GitLab Remote Work Principles

## Core Remote Philosophy
GitLab is one of the world's largest all-remote companies with no physical offices. Their remote work approach is foundational to their identity and success.

### Fundamental Beliefs
- **Remote is not a perk, it's a strategy**: Competitive advantage through global talent access
- **Asynchronous by default**: Respect for different time zones and work styles
- **Documentation over meetings**: Written communication as primary mode
- **Results over presence**: Output matters more than hours logged
- **Trust over surveillance**: Employees treated as responsible adults

## Key Remote Work Principles

### 1. All-Remote vs. Remote-First
- **No headquarters or offices**: Level playing field for all employees
- **No hybrid model**: Everyone operates the same way
- **Equal opportunity**: Promotions and opportunities not tied to location
- **Global mindset**: Decisions consider global workforce from start

### 2. Asynchronous Communication
- **Write it down**: Everything documented in handbook or issues
- **Bias for action**: Don't wait for meetings to make progress
- **Time zone empathy**: Consider colleagues' working hours
- **Meeting discipline**: Meetings as last resort, not first option

### 3. Intentional Communication
- **Overcommunicate**: Share context and reasoning
- **Public by default**: Use public channels over private messages
