## Organizational Principles

### Flat Hierarchy
- **Danish-inspired structure**: Inspired by company's Danish roots
- **Decentralized decision-making**: Authority pushed down to teams
- **Initiative encouraged**: Permission-seeking discouraged
- **Individual empowerment**: Expected to take action without waiting for approval
- **Quote:** "One defining aspect of Doist's operating model is its flat hierarchy... asking for permission is discouraged, with individuals expected to take initiative and act without waiting for approval."

### Squad-Based Structure
- **Small cross-functional teams**: Typically 4-6 people per squad
- **Quarterly cycles**: Work within specific time-bound goals
- **Autonomous execution**: Company direction set by leadership, execution decentralized
- **Project-focused**: Temporary teams formed around specific objectives

### Communication as Core Competency
- **Not an afterthought**: Remote communication treated as fundamental skill
- **Day-one introduction**: All employees learn communication principles immediately
- **Four principles**:
  1. **Assume responsibility**
  2. **Share context**
  3. **Document decisions**
  4. **Move quickly**
