# Doist Asynchronous Communication Framework

## Core Philosophy

### Async-First Approach
**"When we say that we're async first, what we mean is that we're writing first."**

Doist operates as **"a remote and largely async company"** where async communication **"drives team productivity"** and enables **"deep work"**. The foundation is simple: **"when I send you message, you can respond later"** with a general expectation to respond within 24 hours.

### Communication as Competitive Advantage
**"I actually think asynchronous communication is an advantage. Co-located companies would benefit from a more asynchronous approach to communication."**

Doist treats remote communication **not as an afterthought, but as a core competency**. This philosophy drives their entire operational structure and team effectiveness.

## Async Communication in Practice

### Response Expectations
- **24-hour general guideline**: Standard response timeframe
- **Self-managed timing**: "Each person to decide when to check and respond to their messages"
- **No immediate pressure**: Respect for focused work time
- **Context-dependent urgency**: Different matters have different time sensitivities

### Writing-First Culture
- **Primary communication mode**: Most interactions happen through writing
- **Thoughtful responses**: Time to consider and craft quality responses
- **Searchable history**: All communication creates a knowledge base
- **Inclusive participation**: Accommodates different communication styles and time zones

### Quality Over Speed
**"Our approach is different. We want to establish calmer and more thoughtful communication. Our time and attention are the company's most valuable resources so we don't require people to respond immediately to every ping."**
