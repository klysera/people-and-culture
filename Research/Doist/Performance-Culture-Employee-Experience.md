# Doist Performance Culture & Employee Experience

## Performance Philosophy and Culture

### Results-Oriented Work Environment
Doist operates on a **performance-based culture** that prioritizes **outcomes over activity**. The company's approach focuses on **meaningful work completion** rather than traditional time-based metrics.
