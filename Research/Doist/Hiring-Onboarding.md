# Doist Hiring & Onboarding Processes

## Hiring Philosophy

### Remote-First Talent Acquisition
**"Being a remote-first company means they don't need to look locally for talent. If you're interested in working for Doist and you're talented, it doesn't matter where you're basedâ€”as long as you're 'passionate about the project'."**

Doist has been fully remote since hiring their first remote employee in 2011, making them pioneers in distributed work practices. The company has grown to 93 people across 41 nationalities in 39 countries and 75 cities.

## Four-Stage Hiring Process

Doist uses **"a four-stage hiring process to find their next team member: three synchronous interviews and an asynchronous/take-home project."**

### Stage 1: Initial Interview
- **Participants**: Potential future manager
- **Focus**: Values, behavior, and initial fit assessment
- **Communication assessment**: Evaluate written and verbal communication skills

### Stage 2: Team Interview
- **Participants**: Member of the prospective team
- **Focus**:
  - Role-specific requirements
  - Team dynamics and collaboration style
  - Technical competency (role-dependent)

### Stage 3: Leadership Interview
- **Participants**: Member of the leadership team
- **Focus**:
  - Cultural alignment with company values
  - Long-term potential and growth mindset
  - Strategic thinking and problem-solving

### Stage 4: Asynchronous Project
- **Format**: Take-home assignment
- **Approach**: "The candidate is expected to work independently on this, then send it back for review"

## Communication-Centric Evaluation

### Writing Skills Assessment
**"Application questions or cover letters are an opportunity to see how a candidate communicates. This is invaluable on remote teams where asynchronous communication makes up the majority of collaboration."**

### Evolution of Application Process
- **Previous approach**: Heavy use of cover letters
- **Current method**: **"Specific questions that the candidates should answer"**
- **Rationale**: **"More inclusive way to recruit, as some candidates may not know what to include in a cover letter"**
- **Goal**: **"The aim of learning how someone communicates in writing is fulfilled either way!"**

### Ongoing Communication Assessment
**"Between the above stages, Doist are also looking at how the candidate communicates with them. If something comes up, is the candidate proactively telling them? These small details can give real insight into the candidate's true personality."**

Key evaluation criteria:
- **Proactive communication**: Do they share updates without being asked?
- **Problem-solving approach**: How do they handle unexpected issues?
- **Transparency**: Are they open about challenges or setbacks?
- **Cultural alignment**: Does their communication style match async-first culture?

## Onboarding Philosophy

### Intentional Design Approach
**"The first three months when people join Doist are generally very intentionally designed. Number one, to provide small wins along the way. And number two, to expose people to all kinds of work they will be doing in the future."**

### Documentation-First Onboarding
**"We do some things to set up people for success as much as possible. One of them is having a lot of documentation available. So we want people to come in and be able to understand how we do things, why we do things the way we do. We want all of this information to be very accessible, very transparent to people."**
