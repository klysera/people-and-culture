# GitLab Compensation, Benefits & Total Rewards

## Total Rewards Philosophy

### Three Pillars Framework
GitLab's Total Rewards department strategically aligns **three pillars of team member rewards** to create optimal organizational performance:

1. **Compensation**
2. **Benefits**
3. **Equity**

**Mission**: "Total Rewards designs and strategically executes programs in alignment with business goals. Programs fuel motivated and productive team members that are appreciated and rewarded for their contributions, driving GitLab to ever greater success."

## Compensation Framework

### All-Remote Compensation Model
GitLab has developed a comprehensive approach to **all-remote compensation** that addresses the unique challenges of paying a globally distributed workforce fairly and competitively.

### Compensation Calculator (Historical)
- **Previous Tool**: GitLab operated a compensation calculator for transparency
- **Recent Update**: **"As of May 30, 2025, the compensation calculator has been retired as part of our Job Architecture project"**
- **Current Access**: **"Current team members can now access their compensation information through Workday"**
- **Significance**: Move toward more sophisticated, integrated compensation management

### Annual Compensation Review Cycle
GitLab conducts structured annual compensation reviews with specific processes and timing:

- **Purpose**: "Provide managers with the opportunity to reflect on team members' accomplishments, measure achievements against goals, and reward for demonstrated performance and growth potential"
- **Current Status**: "GitLab recently completed their FY26 Annual Compensation Review Cycle"
- **Future Planning**: "Updated information for FY27 to be shared closer to the launch of the next cycle"

## Benefits Structure

### Global Benefits Approach
GitLab offers **"benefits to manage health, wealth, and well-being regardless of location with flexibility in schedule to be there for life's important moments."**

### Benefits Survey and Feedback
GitLab conducts **Global Benefits Surveys** to gather employee feedback and continuously improve their benefits offerings, though specific survey results require internal access.
