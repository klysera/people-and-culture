| 2 | **Truth Over Comfort** | Is this the truth, or what we want to hear? | 💭 Are we being honest about reality? |
| 3 | **Learn Fast, Apply Faster** | What can we learn and apply immediately? | 🚀 How quickly can we apply this insight? |
| 4 | **Excellence with Warmth** | Does this meet our excellence standards? | ⭐ Are we proud to put our name on this? |
| 5 | **Results Over Motion** | Will this deliver measurable results? | 🎯 What specific impact will this create? |
| 6 | **Radical Simplicity** | Can we make this simpler? | ✂️ What complexity can we remove? |
| 7 | **Context Not Control** | Does everyone understand the context? | 🧭 Do people know the why behind this? |
