## Detailed 7-Question Framework

For significant decisions, work through these 7 questions systematically:

    A[Decision Needed] --> B[7 TIK Questions]

    B --> C["1. Have we tested this assumption?"]
    B --> D["2. Is this the truth, or what we want to hear?"]
    B --> E["3. What can we learn and apply immediately?"]
    B --> F["4. Does this meet our excellence standards?"]
    B --> G["5. Will this deliver measurable results?"]
    B --> H["6. Can we make this simpler?"]
    B --> I["7. Does everyone understand the context?"]

    style A fill:#FFD93D
    style J fill:#96CEB4
```

### 1. Have we tested this assumption?
**Relentless Truth Application**
- What evidence supports this approach?
- What experiments could validate our thinking?
- Who has tried this before and what were the results?
- What could we test quickly to gain confidence?

**Quick Tools:** Small pilot programs, customer interviews, market research, A/B testing

### 2. Is this the truth, or what we want to hear?
**Honest Assessment**
- Are we ignoring inconvenient data?
- Who might disagree and why?
- What are we afraid to acknowledge?
- How can we get more objective perspective?

**Quick Tools:** Devil's advocate role, external expert consultation, anonymous feedback collection

### 3. What can we learn and apply immediately?
**Learning Orientation**
- How will this decision teach us something valuable?
- What insights can we gain from this choice?
- How can we apply learnings quickly?
- What feedback loops can we create?

**Quick Tools:** Success metrics definition, learning milestone planning, rapid iteration cycles

### 4. Does this meet our excellence standards?
**Quality Check**
- Are we proud to put our name on this?
- Does this exceed expectations?
- Will this reflect well on our brand?
- How can we make this even better?

**Quick Tools:** Quality checklist review, peer review process, client expectation assessment

### 5. Will this deliver measurable results?
**Impact Focus**
- What specific outcomes will this create?
- How will we measure success?
- What transformation will this enable?
- Why does this matter to our mission?

**Quick Tools:** Success metrics definition, ROI calculation, impact assessment

### 6. Can we make this simpler?
**Simplicity Check**
- What's the simplest version that would work?
- What complexity can we eliminate?
- How can we make this easier to understand?
- What would radical simplicity look like?

**Quick Tools:** Minimum viable approach, complexity audit, user experience review

### 7. Does everyone understand the context?
**Context Sharing**
- What background information is needed?
- Who needs to understand the 'why'?
- How can we ensure alignment?
- What communication is required?

**Quick Tools:** Context briefing sessions, written explanations, Q&A sessions

## When Klysera Values Conflict

Sometimes values seem to conflict. Here's how to resolve:

| Apparent Conflict | Resolution Through TIK |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Speed vs. Excellence** | Find the excellence level that enables speed without compromise |
| **Truth-seeking vs. Deadlines** | Time-box research, use best available data |
| **Individual impact vs. Team impact** | Optimize for collective transformation |
| **Short-term vs. Long-term** | Balance with clear trade-off documentation |

## Decision Documentation Template

## Emergency Decision Protocol

When you must decide immediately:

1. **10-Second TIK Gut Check**
   - Does this feel like Truth? (honest/transparent)
   - Does this feel like Excellence? (proud/quality)
   - Does this feel like Impact? (meaningful/transformative)

2. **If Any Feel Wrong**
   - Can you buy time? Even 5 minutes helps
   - Can you make it reversible?
   - Can you limit scope initially?

3. **Post-Decision**
   - Document why you had to decide quickly
   - Schedule full TIK analysis ASAP
   - Share learnings with team

## Building TIK Decision Muscle

### Daily Practice
- Use TIK for one small decision daily
- Share your TIK reasoning in standups
- Ask "Is this TIK?" before committing

### Weekly Practice
- Document one TIK decision analysis
- Review decisions that weren't TIK
- Identify patterns in your decision-making

### Monthly Practice
- Share TIK decision wins with team
- Analyze one decision that failed TIK
- Refine your TIK intuition
