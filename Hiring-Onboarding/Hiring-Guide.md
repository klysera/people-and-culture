### Core Hiring Principles

**Culture-First Hiring**
We hire for cultural alignment first, then skills. Skills can be developed; cultural fit determines long-term success and team harmony.

**Potential Over Experience**
We look for people who can grow into excellence, not just those who have achieved it in different contexts.

**Diverse Perspectives**
We actively seek different backgrounds, experiences, and thinking styles that strengthen our collective capability.

**Growth Partnership**
We hire people who want to grow with us and help others grow too.
