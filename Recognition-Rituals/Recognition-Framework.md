### Core Recognition Principles

**Immediate and Specific**
Recognition is most powerful when it happens close to the behavior and specifically describes what was excellent.

**Values-Aligned**
Every recognition moment should connect back to our TIK values and operating principles.

**Peer-to-Peer Powered**
The most meaningful recognition often comes from colleagues who witness excellence firsthand.

**Impact-Focused**
We celebrate not just effort, but the transformation and value created.

**Inclusive and Accessible**
Everyone should have opportunities to give and receive recognition regardless of role or level.
