## TIK Communication Examples

### Truth-Based Communication
**Instead of:** "This might work"
**TIK Way:** "Based on our test data, this approach showed 85% success rate"

### Excellence Communication
**Instead of:** "Here's the update"
**TIK Way:** "Here's a comprehensive update with next steps and support needed"

### Impact-Focused Communication
**Instead of:** "We completed the task"
**TIK Way:** "We delivered this solution, which enables the client to achieve X outcome"

## Feedback Framework

### Giving Feedback (Excellence with Warmth)
1. **Start with appreciation** - What's working well
2. **Be specific** - Exact behaviors and impact
3. **Offer support** - How you can help improve
4. **Follow up** - Check progress and provide ongoing support

### Receiving Feedback
1. **Listen actively** - Understand before responding
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Get specific examples
3. **Thank the giver** - Appreciate their investment in you

## Recognition Communication

### TIK Recognition Format
```
üéØ TIK! [Value Name]

[Name], [specific behavior/action] demonstrated
[value] by [impact created].

This is exactly what [value] looks like in action!
Thank you for living TIK!
```
