# GitLab Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Programs

## DIB Strategy and Foundation

### Core Mission
**"Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is fundamental to the success of GitLab. We include it in every way possible and in all that we do."**

**Strategic Focus**: "To do that, we focus on improving our hiring and progression representation of our gender and ethnic-underrepresented groups through inclusive practices that increase our sense of belonging for all of our team members- in line with anti-discrimination principles in each of our locations."

**Connection to Company Mission**: **"GitLab's mission is to make it so that everyone can contribute, and they believe you can't reach everyone unless DIB is core to your company and how you work."**

This integration demonstrates that DIB isn't an add-on program but a **fundamental operating principle** embedded in daily decision-making and organizational culture.
