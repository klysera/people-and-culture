# Zapier Hiring & Onboarding Processes

## Hiring Philosophy

### Values-Based Hiring
Zapier focuses on **cultural fit and remote work capabilities**, looking for candidates who can thrive in an asynchronous, distributed environment. When Zapier was about ten people, they systematically wrote 4-5 characteristics of people who work well there, created rubrics around those characteristics, and developed interview questions to identify the best fits.
