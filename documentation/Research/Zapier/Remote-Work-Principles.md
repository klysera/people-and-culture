## Core Remote Work Philosophy

### 100% Distributed Model
- **No physical office, only virtual presence**
- All teams distributed globally to serve customers better
- Level playing field for all employees regardless of location
- **Quote:** "Zapier is 100% remote with all teams distributed around the world to serve customers better and keep employees connected. There is no physical office, but a virtual one."

### Flexibility as a Core Principle
- Employees encouraged to design work schedules that make them happy and productive
- Options include starting work at 11 AM or swapping weekdays with weekends
- **Haven't implemented 4-day workweeks yet** but focus on time autonomy
- **Quote:** "Working at Zapier is incredibly flexible... employees are encouraged to take control of their time with the flexibility to design a work schedule that makes them feel happy and productiveâ€”whether that means starting work at 11 AM or swapping Tuesdays with Saturdays."

## Three Pillars of Remote Success

### 1. Team (Most Important)
- **Small product teams**: Usually 3-8 people with differing skill sets
- **EPD structure**: Engineer, Product Manager, Designer
- **Singular mission focus**: Each team has full autonomy to set roadmap
- **Quote:** "We've found there are three important ingredients to making remote work successful: team, tools, and process. By far, the most important ingredient is the team."

### 2. Tools
- **Asynchronous communication tools**
- **Slack channels** for connection (#fun-cooking, #fun-music)
- **Video conferencing** for important meetings
- **Documentation platforms** for knowledge sharing

### 3. Process
- **Documented workflows**
- **Clear communication protocols**
- **Structured feedback mechanisms**
- **Regular check-ins and updates**
