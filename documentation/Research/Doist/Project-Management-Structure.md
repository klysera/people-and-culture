# Doist Project Management & Team Structure

## Doist Objectives (DOs) Framework

### Core Structure
Doist uses **"Doist Objectives — DOs for short — centered on project-based squads"** as their primary organizational and project management system.

**"Each squad is a temporary, cross-functional team that works toward a specific goal for one 6-week cycle."**

## Decision-Making Framework

### Flat Hierarchy Benefits
**"One defining aspect of Doist's operating model is its flat hierarchy. Inspired in part by the company's Danish roots, decision-making is pushed down to teams."**

#### Empowerment Principles
- **Initiative encouraged**: **"Asking for permission is discouraged"**
- **Individual action**: **"Individuals expected to take initiative and act without waiting for approval"**
- **Team autonomy**: Squads have authority to make relevant decisions
- **Decentralized execution**: Leadership sets direction, teams determine implementation

### Meritocratic Decision Making
**"95% of Doist's team communication is asynchronous and transparent and searchable which supports one of Doist's core beliefs: the best argument always wins – regardless of who you are, your title, or your seniority."**

#### Key Characteristics
- **Argument quality**: Ideas evaluated on merit, not hierarchy
- **Transparent discussion**: Open debate and reasoning
- **Title-agnostic**: Senior and junior voices carry equal weight when logic is sound
- **Evidence-based**: Data and reasoning drive decisions
